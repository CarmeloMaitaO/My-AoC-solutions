# My progress on AoC 2024: day 2

Here's my daily analisis of my performance and how I could get better during this year AoC.

| What I did | What I saw others do | General take |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| Separated the fetching, parsing and solving of the problem in 3 different modules. In the solution I made a procedure to check whether the given report is safe or not; to do this, it first check if it is sorted and then I implement and for-loop, that first checks the current index and the checks the difference between values of the adjacent levels of the report; the check is done after knowing its index, were it be 0 or the last one, it will only check against the next and previous level. This procedure is called inside a for-loop that traverses the entire input, and increments a counter every time a safe report is found; after that, the counter is outputted and the solution for the first part of the problem is found. For the second part, I made another procedure that copies the given report to an auxiliary variable, and deletes the specified index of the sequence through concatenating the spaces before and after said index; after that, it just call the first procedure I made, with the auxiliary variable as parameter. This new procedure gets called inside a for-loop that traverses every index of the given report, which is also inside another for-loop that traverses the entire input. It increments a counter every time it finds a safe report, then it output the said counter and the answer for the second part is found. On the non technical side of the matter, I neither slept nor read the instructions carefully, and in the end that made me not only misunderstand what was being requested, but also downgraded the quality of the code I wrote and my speed while writing it | I saw others using libraries that are specific of their languages, and for this challenge, Python's itertools was a frequent find, given that it has a procedure called pairwise that solved the problem of pairing the levels of a report to then calculate the difference between then. Given that I also joined the Nim community's private leaderboard, I also got the chance to see how [another person](https://github.com/pietroppeter/advent-of-code-2024) solved this problem using the same language I was using: for safety check of the first part, a procedure was made, but it manually check if the report rather than using the isSorted procedure, but that is because it is joined with the check of the difference between levels, which made it a much simpler and efficient solution. For the second part this person also deleted the specified index by concatenating the levels before and after it, and implemented the loop that check every index of the given report inside another procedure | I'll stop trying to compete in the matter of time, given that I don't have the skill to quickly solve the challenges at 00:30 (my time) without significantly reducing my sleep. This challenge could have been quickly done (in a not so efficient manner) by first relying on the isSorted procedure and then just traversing the report using a for-loop that instead of checking the index everytime, it just goes from 0 to the penultimate index, checking only the difference that exist with the next value. Also, I need to add a mechanism to test the answers with the given example input without writing a different file |
