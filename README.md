# My Advent Of Code Solutions

My solutions for the Advent of code. Ordered in years and days. Every day has
its own project setup made in [Nix](https://nixos.org/), to get started execute
`nix develop` inside a "day##" folder. The solutions will ask you to input your
AoC session key to download your specific input, this is optional, but in case
you want to use this feature, you can get it inside the developer console of
your browser, in the "storage" tab, select "Cookies" and copy the value of your
session.
